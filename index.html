			<p class="insight">A mixture of Custom Javascript and Wordpress Templates. The task was to simplify the User Interface &amp; hopefully having the knock on effect of improving the User Experience for their catalogue website. Built using Vue.js on the front-end, talking to a headless Wordpress CMS and wrapped inside of NUXT.js, for some baked-in SEO goodness. Using analytics and user feedback as a guide, we began prototyping fully functional layouts, forms, navigational elements &amp; menus as the starting point, once stress-tested and approved, the components were composed into templates and retrofitted with the overall visual strategy, mainly dictating color, font and visual arrangment. <a href="#">See a snapshot of my work.</a></p><br/>

As front-end sentinel my main task was to establish a style guide and to refactor old crappy
but functioning legacy code into semantically beautiful mark-up across literally thousands of
pages. Bliss! This is of course far from glamorous but turning wrongs into rights builds
experience faster than reading tuts or browsing forums. I also did their HTML Newsletters,
Mailers, Banners, Icons and some other ad hoc digital stuff. The best part of the job was
definitely the table-tennis board; the worst had to be the relentless cross browser testing. My
development focus was on their in-house reservation system, which was in dire need of
some love, but I mean dire. The current website leaves a lot to be desired and I had no hand
in that whatsoever, scouts honour.

Transport for Cape Town is one man’s misguided journey to solve a city’s problem by
building a visual integrated multi-modal public transport information system. I’ve been
researching the public transport system in Cape Town for the past almost 2 years now.
During that time, I have developed several prototypes that encapsulate the multi-modal
transport network in aksie. We all have that project that we’re going to do, this is one of mine.

User Interface Designer / contractor (UK client)
I acted as a bridge between the design studio and the development team remotely.
http://www.firedog-design.co.uk - October 2006 – October 2007
I have been working on and off with Firedog for the past 4-5 and in case you’re wondering,
we have fought, yes, but we’ve also made up and that dear reader, is growth. I Thank You!

During that time my core role was that of web monkey. I worked on the development of wire-
frames, functional specs, did hours of cross-browser and QA sobbing while focusing on

usability, accessibility and strict adherence to W3C standards especially the inclusion of
WCAG (at least level 1) on every project. Projects included Confirmit, Xansa, Liquid
Telecom, London Parties, Inclarity and Sygnia. I also managed 2 projects from A-Y.
Concurrently I consulted with Questionmark on the following prototypes: Transcript Report, Score List
Report, Browser Based Translation Management System and their TCMS range of software. Other
roles included Front-end Developer, Web Developer, Web Designer and Web Monkey.
HTML, XHTML, XSLT, CSS, Photoshop, JavaScript, Macromedia MX Suite, XML, QA, MS Office, PowerPoint, Wire-frames, Paper

www.questionmark.com - April 2005 – September 2006
I largely participated in the detailed UI design of their front-end software. Completed projects
included over 50 prototypes 11 of which are fully functional interfaces in commercial use
today. I facilitated this through effective user research and in-house use case studies. I
worked with product designers to produce illustrative and working prototypes for
enhancements to and new functionality for the product portfolio. I produced designs and user
story documentation for the development team i.e. paper prototyping, wire-frames, and
flowcharts. I worked closely with the various development teams to ensure designs were
implemented correctly and to help resolve implementation hiccups like cross-browser
compatibility issues etc. Very very corporate but equally challenging. Enjoyed my time there.
